There were a few items that I missed from the original documentation I wrote last week on installing Mediawiki and LAMP. 
So this past week, Yasir worked to figure out how to install Mediawiki onto a new usb and documenting all the possible missing 
steps. For some reason the 256GB usb I bought from Amazon was not able to read on any computer after attempting to install Ubuntu 
multiple times. We switched to my other 64GB USB and Yasir was able to get Ubuntu installed. 

Documentation for installing mediawiki is nearly complete, so now I will be focusing on documenting protocols. 
I should have information on the protocols by our next meeting prior to class which is this Wednesday the 11th. 

I am currently looking for gifs to help show each protocol like the image below.
